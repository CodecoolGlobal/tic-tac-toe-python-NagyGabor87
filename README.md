# Tic-Tac-Toe

The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner.

The project was built mainy to understand the usage of the [if __name__ == "__main__"](https://realpython.com/if-name-main-python/) condition,
and to create multiple "script functions" to import them to the main file.
The game is playable with two persons, and with an easy and advanced AI as well.
